# SOLIDPrinciples
Examples explaining the SOLID principles OOD (Object Oriented Design)

### Exists 5 Design principles
* S stands for SRP (Single responsibility principle)
* O stands for OCP (Open closed principle)
* L stands for LSP (Liskov substitution principle)
* I stands for ISP (Interface segregation principle)
* D stands for DIP (Dependency inversion principle)

**1. SRP (Single responsibility principle)**
> A class that have a single responsibility and not muiltiple, the class can move in all the activities of the system.

**2. OCP (Open closed principle)**
> In OOP the entities i.e. classes, functions, modules, etc. Should be open by extension and closed by modification. Extend the behavior and the source code is not modified.

**3. LSP (Liskov substitution principle)**

> If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program. Barbara Liskov - 1987.

**4. ISP (Interface segregation principle)**
> The client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use (Interface concept).

**5. DIP (Dependency inversion principle)**
> It refers to a specific form of decoupling software modules.It states.
> * High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> * Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
